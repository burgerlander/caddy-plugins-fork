# Gemtext cheatsheet

This is a quick "cheatsheet" intended for people who haven't been writing Gemtext for long or who need their memory refreshed after a break.  If you're completely new to Gemtext and you need things explained in a more detail, you should check out the full length introduction:

## Text

Here's the basics of how text works in Gemtext:

* Long lines get wrapped by the client to fit the screen
* Short lines *don't* get joined together
* Write paragraphs as single long lines
* Blank lines are rendered verbatim

## Links

At the bare minimum, a link line consists of just the characters `=>` and a URL.  Here's a link to this page:

```
=> gemini://geminiprotocol.net/docs/cheatsheet.gmi
```

But you can include labels with links, and probably should most of the time.  Labels are separated from the URL by one or more spaces or tabs:

```
=> gemini://geminiprotocol.net/docs/cheatsheet.gmi	Gemtext cheatsheet
```

## Headings

You get three levels of heading:

```
# Heading

## Sub-heading

### Sub-subheading
```

## Lists

You get one kind of list and you can't nest them:

```
* Mercury
* Gemini
* Apollo
```

## Quotes

Here's a quote from Maciej CegÅ‚owski:

```
> I contend that text-based websites should not exceed in size the major works of Russian literature.
```

## Pre-fromatted text

Lines which start with ``` will cause clients to toggle in and out of ordinary rendering mode and preformatted mode. In preformatted mode, Gemtext syntax is ignored so links etc. will not be rendered, and text will appear in a monospace font.

```
<script>alert("HTML tags should not get rendered!")</script>
```
